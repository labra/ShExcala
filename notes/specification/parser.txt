Positive tests that don't pass:


Failed tests that pass:

1.- 1unknowndatatypeMaxInclusive: 
	It is grammatically correct but applies a numeric facet to an unknown datatype 
	and it seems that it is not allowed

2.- STRING_LITERAL_LONG1-ending-APOSTROPHE 

<http://a.example/IssueShape> {
   <http://a.example/p1> ('''abc')
}

My parser recognizes it as a value set with two values: 
   the empty literal '' and the literal 'abc'
   I think, the grammar doesn't impose to include a space between two literals 
   so it may be ok
   
3.- Language tag normalization

It seems that language tags are stored lower-cased (it should be documented somewhere)

4.- BNode generation

The serialization to JSOn asumes that there is a Bnode generator starting from _:b0
